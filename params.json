{"name":"Mapmove","tagline":"Python and Bootstrap web app built on Google App Engine","body":"# MapMove: Where is the Jedi? \r\n\r\nMapMove is a web app that lets you put a Star Wars character anywhere on the world map. You can select one of 12 characters and enter a location in free-text. The app does a geo-location lookup for your specified location and places your selected character at that location on the map.\r\n\r\n**Live URL: http://shanrao-mapmove.appspot.com**\r\n\r\n**Technology Stack**\r\n* Frontend\r\n  * Bootstrap\r\n* Backend Application\r\n  * Python\r\n  * Jinja\r\n* APIs and Services\r\n  * Google Maps Geocoding API\r\n  * Google Maps Javascript API\r\n* Compute\r\n  * Google App Engine\r\n* Datastore\r\n  * NDB (non-SQL)\r\n\r\n![MapMove](/doc/MapMove_Initial.png)\r\n\r\n## Beautiful Frontend\r\n\r\nAll views are beautifully designed using Bootstrap based CSS. Feedback and application errors are elegantly presented using Javascript handlers.\r\n\r\n![MapMove](/doc/MapMove_Selection.png)\r\n\r\n## Powerful Backend\r\n\r\nThe app is written in Python. Jinja enables frontend templating. Google Map APIs are used to get geo-location information.\r\n\r\n![MapMove](/doc/MapMove_History.png)\r\n\r\n## Massively Scalable Compute and Datastore\r\n\r\nThe application is built on Google App Engine, with features such as auto-scaling, caching, and sophisticated management dashboards. \r\n\r\nThe datastore uses NDB, a schemaless object datastore providing robust, scalable storage.\r\n\r\n![MapMove](http://www.github.com/qwertyshan/MapMove/blob/master/doc/MapMove_GAE.png)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
